# Speech-to-text-website
### Build a user interface to convert voice to text (speech to text) 
### Save the text output to database

#### Built a UI to convert audio to text using Web Speech API, and saved the converted text to a MySQL database using Node.js.   The project is designed so that the user can speak, and his speech is converted into text and displayed in the interface, and then this text is saved in the MySQL database for access to it later.
